Today i begin by first creating a Github account (https://github.com/naijacyberguy). 
Once I made my Github account, I publicly committed to the coding challenge across i am embarking on.
Next, i set up my profile, created the http://README.md, and completed the Github "Hello World" tutorial where I...

Created an open source repository
Started and manage a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a Pull Request

With the basics of Github out of the way, I start "𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗿  𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱" Udemy Course with code exercises uploaded
It's worth noting at this point i am already on a linux OS and will be using VScodium as my daily tool

Today the course showed me:

1) Running Python Code

2) How to get course resources

3) Resources Exercises to solve

4) Basic Python commands to try on terminal and  on VScodium
